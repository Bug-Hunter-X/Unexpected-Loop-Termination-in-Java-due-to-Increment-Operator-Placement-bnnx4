This repository showcases a subtle Java code error involving an unexpected loop termination. The issue arises from the placement of the increment operator (i++) within the loop's body.  The `break` statement's behavior is affected by this order, and careful attention to increment and loop control structures is vital to avoid this type of error. The solution demonstrates a correct approach to ensure proper loop behavior.
